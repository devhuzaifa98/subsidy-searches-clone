                        related to these Terms or your use of the Service will
                        be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less
                        formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
                        neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow
                        for more limited discovery than in court, and can be
                        subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
                        can award the same damages and relief that a court can
                        award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all

                        A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send
                        a written notice of the dispute to the other party by
                        U.S. Mail or electronic mail (“Notice”). Allied Premium
                        Insurance, LLC’s address for Notice is: 1550 Sawgrass
                        Corporate Pkwy, Sunrise, FL 33323 or
                        info@enhancehealth.com . The Notice must: (a) describe
                        the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b)
                        set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The
                        parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the
                        claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an
                        agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is
                        received, you or Allied Premium Insurance, LLC may
                        commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                        arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
                        you or Allied Premium Insurance, LLC must not be
                        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
                        makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute
                        is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor,
                        Allied Premium Insurance, LLC will pay you the highest
                        of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the
                        arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement
                        amount offered by Allied Premium Insurance, LLC in
                        settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
                        award; or (iii) $1,000.

                        If you commence arbitration in accordance with these
                        Terms, Allied Premium Insurance, LLC will reimburse you
                        for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is
                        for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which
                        case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA
                        Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a
                        location to be agreed upon in Broward County, Florida,
                        but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose
                        whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on
                        the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b)
                        through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c)
                        by an in-person hearing in Broward County, Florida. If
                        the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
                        claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or
                        brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
                        standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
                        11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by
                        the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
                        Allied Premium Insurance, LLC for all monies previously
                        disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to
                        pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in
                        which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must
                        issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
                        the essential findings and conclusions on which the
                        decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator
                        may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
                        and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during
                        the proceeding and upon request from either party made
                        within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
